// Look at the `./src/App.jsx` file: there is a `<main>` element containing three `Box` components with different colors.

// Note that the `<main>` wrapper is a flex container which is why the `Box` components are aligned horizontically.

// Task: Outsource the three `Box` components to a `Boxes` component.

// - In the `App.jsx` file, create a `Boxes` component which
//   - returns the same three `Box` components as given above.
//   - For now, use a `<div>` component as a wrapper in the return statement of the `Boxes` component.
// - In the `App` component, replace the three `Box` components with the `Boxes` component.

// Check the browser: the boxes are now vertically aligned! ðŸ˜±

// The reason is this: a flexbox refers only to its direct child elements; however, using a `<div>` element in `Boxes` creates a new layer so that the three `Box` elements are no longer flex items!

// Use the developer tools of your browser to check this fact.

// To fix this, replace the `<div>` with fragments `<></>`: they won't create an HTML element and thus break the layout!

// ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you have seen the basic reason why and how to use React fragments!

// > ðŸ’¡ Layout with flexbox is not the only reason for using fragments, but it's an easy-to-understand example. In general, fragments are a great way to avoid unnecessary `<div>` clutter.
